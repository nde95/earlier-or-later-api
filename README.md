# Earlier or Later - Node/Express TypeScript API

Welcome to the Node/Express TypeScript API for "Earlier or Later"! This API is designed to provide backend functionality and support for the "Earlier or Later" React game.

## This API is DEPRECIATED.

Backend functionality has been replaced with my [Laravel](https://github.com/nde95/earlier-later-laravel) API.

## Overview

"Earlier or Later" is a game where players guess whether a photo was taken earlier or later than another event. This API serves as the backend to manage user authentication, game data, and scores.

## Features

- User authentication: Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- Game management: Handles game sessions, images, and user scores.
- RESTful endpoints: Provides endpoints for interacting with user accounts and game data.
- TypeScript support: Written in TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience.
- Express framework: Utilizes Express for routing and handling HTTP requests.
